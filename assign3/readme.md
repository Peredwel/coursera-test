Issues with CORS?

The errors I keep receiving for this are: 

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)index.html:1 

XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com/menu_items.json. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:63342' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 404.

Googling suggests it's a CORS issue, but that doesn't explain why I don't have difficulty accessing the app in any of the instructor-given code.
